# Maturity vs Gene Expression

Most brain neurons develop before birth and remain throughout life. The dentate gyrus continues producing new neurons after birth, aiding distinct memory creation. This project utilizes a dataset of gene activity in individual neurons to categorize cells by age. This data is from a study by Habib et al., titled "Div-Seq: Single-nucleus RNA-Seq reveals dynamics of rare adult newborn neurons" (Science, 2016: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471252).

Lars2 and Malat1 represent gene expression levels tied to neuron maturation. Our project delves into understanding the gene-neuron maturity link in the dentate gyrus. You can access the dataset here: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1cN2Ah5fvJoYyYHg8zVhN_JhCVOHaiRrb
