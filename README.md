# Maturity vs Gene Expression

Most brain neurons develop before birth and remain throughout life. The dentate gyrus continues producing new neurons after birth, aiding distinct memory creation. This project utilizes a dataset containing gene activity measurements from individual neurons to classify cells based on their age. Our project explores the gene-neuron maturity link in the dentate gyrus, specifically focusing on the Lars2 and Malat1 genes.


## Dataset

This data is from a study by Habib et al., titled "Div-Seq: Single-nucleus RNA-Seq reveals dynamics of rare adult newborn neurons" (Science, 2016: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471252).

- Number of observations: 818
- Description: This dataset highlights the expression levels of the Lars2 and Malat1 genes, both of which exhibit elevated expression during the maturation of neurons. Additionally, the data incorporates a binary measure of maturity, with cells coded as mature (1, corresponding to cell_age = 14 days) or immature (0, corresponding to cell_age < 14 days)."
